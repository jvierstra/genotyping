1) run-phasing-dnaseI.tcsh: creates phased files by chromosome over all samples using impute.sh (eagle and Minimac3)

2) run-phaser-rnase.tcsh: uses dnaseI phased file and RNA-seq bam file to impute haplotype information per sample, per chromosome
     "Requires a VCF and BAM, produces a VCF with computed haplotype phases and result files containing haplotype details,
      statistics, and read counts. By default only sites with the "PASS" flag in the VCF will be considered..."

3) run-phaser-ae-rnase.tcsh: determines allelic expression over list of genes and log2fc of reference vs. alternate allele haplotype
    The output is 1 line for every gene annotation (very large files), which is then filtered to only those where differences exist.

4) combine-ae-rnase-annotations.tcsh: 
    Merges all allelic expression over all chromosomes and all samples into a final output
