These scripts are written to work in the following directory structure:
data/
cp *.tcsh src/
cp -R status src.stats/

There is the parallel directory described in data-creation/
data/

These scripts create and dump calculations in results/
1) run-phasing-imputation-dnaseI.tcsh -> phasing then imputatin using DNaseI tags
2) combine-SNVs-imputed-dnaseI.tcsh -> aggregate results after filtering for R2>=0.3
3) run-phaser-rnase.tcsh -> per individual haplotypes using DNaseI genotyping+imputation calls and RNA-seq
     (note: copies over genotyping results into data/ ; when written *.tbi files were unavailable)
4) run-phaser-ae-rnase.tcsh -> haplotypes and gene/transcript information to determine allelic expression
5) combine-ae-rnase-annotations.tcsh -> aggregate allelic expression information
6) filter-ae-rnase.tcsh -> simplify results, mark likely outliers, filter those and produce top/bottom 500.

These scripts create and dump calculations in results.stats/
1) dnaseI.stats.tcsh
2) rnaseq-stats.tcsh

These create lots of background jobs on a machine for now (ran on dev0|1)
